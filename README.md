### About
CRY is a reimagining of Jaguar Doom for PC, built on top of the [International Doom](https://github.com/jnechaevsky/international-doom) engine. To ensure high emulation accuracy, substantial parts of the original Jaguar Doom code were integrated — including damage formulas, monster behavior, Nightmare difficulty mechanics, and sector/line specials.

The goal was never to create a 1:1 port of Jaguar Doom for modern systems. Instead, I aimed to strike a balance between authenticity, visual polish, and overall enjoyment — while paying close attention to detail wherever possible.

The project is created by [Julia Nechaevskaya](https://jnechaevsky.github.io/author.html).
